# Simple-Binary-Game
 
## How it works
In this game, you convert binary numbers into decimal values by calculating the corresponding weights of the '1's in the binary representation.

### Example Console Output:
```
  0   0   1   0   0   0   1   1
128  64  32  16   8   4   2   1
```

To get the decimal result, add the values of the positions where there are '1's:
- In this case: \( 32 + 2 + 1 = 35 \)

Type the result in the console to check your answer!
